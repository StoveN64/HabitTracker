Description:
Jumplist was orignially thought up as a way for my friend and I to catalog co-op video games to play. We had such a growing list it became hard to sort through our Steam wishlists. This website was orignally for co-op videeo games, but it can be used for anything you want to track and complete. It was also built as my Dev-Moutain Capstone project. Anything you want to write down and complete, Jumplist can help you!
